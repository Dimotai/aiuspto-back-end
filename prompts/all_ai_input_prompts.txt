There are 5 (five) steps listed below. Carefully produce results for each step, and compile them into a full detailed response.

1. Extract all rejection categories in the requirements provided using the XML-formatted text attached to this request. Also, extract and correctly group ALL claim numbers under each rejection in the same paragraph (e.g., "Claims 1-4, 9, 23, and 15-18"), and include the corresponding rejection type (e.g. “35 USC 102(a)(1)”). Include the prior art references cited in the rejections (e.g. “US 4,458,876”). These prior art references typically have more than 5 digits, ignoring commas or slashes that are separating the digits.
Provide me output of all extracted claims in the following format:

Extracted claims:
(claim(s))
Corresponding Rejection Paragraph(s) and related claims:
(rejection paragraphs - claim(s) - related prior art references to the claim, typically have more than 5 digits, ignoring commas or slashes that are separating the digits.)
List of related references:
(references + alias - corresponding rejection paragraph(s))

2. Using the XML document attached, extract all detailed reference data for any rejection paragraph that falls under categories 102 or 103. For each of these paragraphs, list me their data in this format:

U.S. Patent Reference:
- Patent Number: (number)
- Designation: (alias)
- Citation Type: (102 or 103 rejection)
- Claim number(s): (range of applicable claim numbers)
U.S. Patent Application Reference:
- Application number: (application number)
- Designation: (alias)
- Citation type: (102 or 103 rejection)
- Claim numbers: (range of applicable claim numbers)

3. Create and print me a full bullet list of all these requirements.
In each bullet, in the XML document attached below, if and for every 102 or 103 rejection-type paragraph (typically starts with “Regarding claim #” or “Regarding claims #-#”), reprint the FULL paragraph. In each printed paragraph, create an in-line tag around each citation (include only the referenced location, typically page/col/line/figure #s between each tag) and all mentioned reference name aliases (i.e. Schaeper, LeRouax, etc.)

4. Create and print me a full bullet list of all these requirements.
In each bullet, in the XML document attached below, if in a section with a header “Drawing” or “Specification”, and if a paragraph in this section contains the following key phrase(s):
“is objected to because”
“it is suggested”
“appropriate correction is required”
“informalities”
Reprint the entire paragraph.
