- <Paragraph 18>A rejection based on double patenting of the "same invention" type finds its support in the language of 35 U.S.C. 101 which states that "whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process… may obtain a patent therefor…" (Emphasis added). Thus, the term "same invention," in this context, means an invention drawn to identical subject matter. See <Reference>US14586938</Reference>, 151 U.S. 186 (1894); <Reference>US5469846</Reference>, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); <Reference>US2448467</Reference>, 245 F.2d 467, 114 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1957).</Paragraph 18>
- <Paragraph 19>A statutory type (35 U.S.C. 101) double patenting rejection can be overcome by canceling or amending the claims that are directed to the same invention so they are no longer coextensive in scope. The filing of a terminal disclaimer cannot overcome a double patenting rejection based upon 35 U.S.C. 101.</Paragraph 19>
- <Paragraph 23>Claims 1-18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 as claiming the same invention as that of claims 1-18 of prior U.S. Patent No. <Reference>US8430328B2</Reference> to Yoshida, Applicant (cited by Applicant, hereinafter "328 patent"). This is a statutory double patenting rejection.</Paragraph 23>
